# PythonFinalProject
This repository is for storing my Python 3200k final project, which is to create a map in the ArcMap program using python script and map data. The map will depict all jails/prisons/correctional facilities within the metro Atlanta area, and will be created using only python script. The end result of this project will be a map that can easily be edited and updated by altering or adding to the script.The data that I accessed to get the correctional facility points was [Georgia Open Data](http://data-georgiagio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d2f6f0dc62204a8cb8dddd9226348d95_4).
